## This is a simulation project for double pendulum

* The original idea was come from the interesting little GIF on this [web page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory).
* Thanks for scientists and researchers from MIT and USYD to provide the numerical equations. Here are the links to them: [MIT](http://web.mit.edu/jorloff/www/chaosTalk/double-pendulum/double-pendulum-en.html), [USYD](http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/~wheat/dpend_html/).
